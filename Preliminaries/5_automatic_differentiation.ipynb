    "\n",
    "Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks take this work off our plates by offering automatic differentiation (often shortened to autograd). As we pass data through each successive function, the framework builds a computational graph that tracks how each value depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation works backwards through this graph applying the chain rule. The computational algorithm for applying the chain rule in this fashion is called backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, while we use autograd to optimize models (in a statistical sense) the optimization of autograd libraries themselves (in a computational sense) is a rich subject of vital interest to framework designers. Here, tools from compilers and graph manipulation are leveraged to compute results in the most expedient and memory-efficient manner.\n",

    "Sometimes, we wish to move some calculations outside of the recorded computational graph. For example, say that we use the input to create some auxiliary intermediate terms for which we do not want to compute a gradient. In this case, we need to detach the respective computational graph from the final result. The following toy example makes this clearer: suppose we have z = x * y and y = x * x but we want to focus on the direct influence of x on z rather than the influence conveyed via y. In this case, we can create a new variable u that takes the same value as y but whose provenance (how it was created) has been wiped out. Thus u has no ancestors in the graph and gradients do not flow through u to x. For example, taking the gradient of z = x * u will yield the result u, (not 3 * x * x as you might have expected since z = x * x * x)"

For instance, we can make them depend on auxiliary variables or condition choices on intermediate results. One benefit of using automatic differentiation is that even if building the computational graph of a function required passing through a maze of Python control flow (e.g., conditionals, loops, and arbitrary function calls), we can still calculate the gradient of the resulting variable."
